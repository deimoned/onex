# Group file format

This is the description for the group files generated by the `saveGroup` command and read by the `loadGroup` command.

## Full group file

The first line contains file version, st, and properties of the dataset it comes from
```
<file_version> <st> <item_count> <item_length>
```

The second and third line contains the range of representative lengths and the distance used
```
<from_length> <to_length>
<distance>
```

For each of the next (`<to-length> - <from_length> + 1`) blocks of lines, each block has the following format
```
<number_of_groups>
<group_description>
<group_description>
<group_description>
...
(repeat <number_of_groups> times)
```

A `<group_description>` has 2 lines
```
<representative>
<number_of_time_series> <index> <start> <index> <start> ...
(the <index> <start> pair repeats <number_of_time_series> times)
```
Note that `<representative>` is a list of data points of a sequence; whereas we encode sequences in a group using their index and starting position. The reason is that a representative may be computed, not present in the dataset.

## Group size only file

These files only contain the group size information, thus much smaller. They contain everything as the above format except that the `<group_description>s` are on the same line for each representative length and each `<group_description>` does not have `<representative>` and the `<index> <start>` list.
